1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?

The RISC-V calling convention passes arguments in registers when possible. Up to eight integer registers, a0–a7, and up to eight floating-point registers, fa0–fa7, are used for this purpose.
a2 holds 13 in main's call to printf.


2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

26 li a1,12. There is no call to f and g, the compiler calculated the result of f(8)+1 and passed it to the second parameter of the function printf.


3. At what address is the function printf located?

0x628


4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

38
